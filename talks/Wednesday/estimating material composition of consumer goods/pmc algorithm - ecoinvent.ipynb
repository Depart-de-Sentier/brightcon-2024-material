    "This script allows to estimate the material composition (MC) of products using real product datasets in ecoinvent database.\n",
    "\n",
    "See paper: Amatuni, L., Steubing, B., Heijungs, R., Yamamoto, T., & Mogoll√≥n, J. M. Deriving material composition of products using life cycle inventory databases. Journal of Industrial Ecology. https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13538\n",
    "\n",
    "We highly recommend visiting this paper first to gain a solid understanding of the implementation of this product composition estimation algorithm. We suggest first reviewing a simpler and more universal script \"pmc algorithm - general.py\" for detailed comments for each code line. This script is an extension of that general script tailoring it to perform on the ecoinvent database. \n",
    "The comments under this script will be rather limited. \n",
    "\n",
    "REQUIREMENTS: \n",
    "- To run this script in Spyder or VS Code you need first to prepare a separate conda environment with an installed Brightway 2 (not 2.5!) framework and (optionally) the Activity Browser GUI on top.\n",
    "Installing Activity Browser in a separate conda environment as instructed on the AB website will install Brightway and all the packages needed, so this is a good starting point.  \n",
    "- Basic understanding of Python and Brightway is required to be able to replicate this code for your own products/materials/LCI database of interest\n",
    "- LCI database: ecoinvent 3.10 cutoff database and the 'biosphere3' database available in your Brigthway project(see constants section for proper linking)"

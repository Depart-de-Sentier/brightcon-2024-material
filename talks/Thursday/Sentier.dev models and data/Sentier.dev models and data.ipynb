    "\n",
    "One awesome benefit of this approach is how easy maintenance beceomes - as new data enters the system, the continuous integration does an assessment across the whole database of what has changed, why it changed, and how much closer the database as a whole is to our defined validation goals. An example of a validation goal could be that we include enough emissions of PFAS to account for the marginal change in observed regional concentrations. We can then automatically approve the new data (and send the submitter the report on why their contribution mattered) if the changes are within our accepted norms, or escalate the data to a working group or the broader community.\n",
    "\n",
    "The volunteers currently supporting DdS have no interest in arguing about system models, and will start with data and models which can reproduce measured flows in the economy and into and out of the environment. We welcome people building other system models in our platform."

For example, the input is available or commonly imported from another place - we call the transport model to supplement our production model. We have similar things for stocks/flows and certain types of storage. In this sense, a given model can change its local graph structure, but not the global graph structure. We're still thinking about how to implement this, you are free to read and contribute to these discussions:\n",

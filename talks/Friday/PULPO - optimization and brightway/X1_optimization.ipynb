    "In the seminal work from [Adisa Azapagic (1999)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S1385-8947(99)00042-X) the concept of [[Life Cycle Optimization]] (LCO) for process selection and design has been first introduced. This early intersection of the concept of LCA and Process Systems Engineering (PSE) adhered to a PSE-centric way of handling the LCA problem. This means that the original PSE models are retained, and **additional** variables, parameters and constraints are added, in order to define new (*environmental*) design criteria. This idea is effectively illustrated on the extended heat exchange example from before:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before**, the heat exchange problem was addressed by minimizing economic costs, which included the utility costs for heating and cooling, as well as the capital cost of the heat exchanger. The objective was to find the optimal balance between these costs, leading to the most cost-effective degree of integration.\n",

    "**Now**, we shift our focus to an environmental objective. The **needed changes** to the problem formulation are as follows:\n",
    "__________________\n",
    "##### New Objective Function: Minimize Emissions\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Instead of minimizing the total cost, the objective function will now aim to minimize the total emissions:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **Emissions from Utilities**: These are calculated based on the energy used for heating and cooling, multiplied by the respective emission factors.\n",
    "   - **Emissions from Heat Exchanger Installation**: These are estimated using a formula that takes into account the area of the heat exchanger.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The new objective function can be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Total Emissions} = \\textcolor{#FF8C00}{EF_{hot}} \\cdot (T_{h,out} - T_{h,out}^{\\text{target}}) \\cdot C_{hot}  + \\textcolor{#1E90FF}{EF_{cold}} \\cdot (T_{c,out}^{\\text{target}} - T_{c,out}) \\cdot C_{cold} + \\textcolor{#9370DB}{EF_A} \\cdot A\n",
    "   $$\n",

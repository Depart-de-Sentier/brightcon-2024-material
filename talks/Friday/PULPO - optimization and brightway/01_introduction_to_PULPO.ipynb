    "The current form of square technosphere matrices is a consequence of the search for a unique solution to the inventory problem. See [Heijungs and Suh (2002)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-94-015-9900-9) for an excellent overview of the computational structure of LCA, also commenting upon the topic of optimization (*Linear Programming*).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reference, the use of optimization to deal with multi-functional units that lead to rectangular matrices and non-unique solutions has been highlighted. The previous approach builds upon this idea, by constructing rectangular technology choice matrices in a <span style=\"color: dodgerblue; font-weight: bold;\">bottom-up</span> fashion. The matrix is concatenated from various inventories, specifying identical products from distinct processes in the same row. See the [example data](data/rice_husk_example_TCM_data.xlsx) for the rice husk example from the following notebook. Compiling all of this data by hand in a spreadsheet ensures that the practitioner takes concious decisions about which data to include, but can be a limiting factor when moving to much more complex problems, as illustrated in the CCU case study in the [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1111/jiec.13561).\n",

    "With PULPO we are proposing a <span style=\"color: orange; font-weight: bold;\">top-down</span> approach, capitalizing on the already existing information in commercial and user LCIs. Departing from the square matrix, rows of identical products are summed up, leading to a technology (*or regional*) choice for the supply of this product in all other processes that utilize this product.\n",

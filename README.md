# Brightcon 2024 Talks and Hackathon Material

## Instructions for Presenters

Please upload your presentation materials to this repository. Each talk should have reproducible examples that show your library or data source in a way that people can use at the conference on our shared servers, and afterwards on their personal machines.

Please to the following for your talk:

* Add your talk to the correct day below as a pull request. You can find your talk time [at the online program](https://2024.brightcon.link/programme).
* Add a new folder to the day of your talk named with the title of your talk.
* If you want to adjust the title, please submit a pull request to [the conference website](https://github.com/Depart-de-Sentier/brightcon-2024-website). The schedule content is at `content/agenda/conference.md`.
* Upload your talk material to the new folder. You *must* include either a `requirements.txt` (if we can just use pypi) or `environment.yml` (if you require anaconda) file.
* Please tag @tngtudor and @cmutel in your pull request.
